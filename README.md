# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using machine learning. It involves data ingestion, preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding), and building models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression. The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and RÂ² for accuracy.
