# Laptop Price Prediction

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict laptop prices based on features like brand, specifications, and other relevant attributes. The process involves data ingestion, preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding), and model building using techniques like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Linear Regression**. The models' performance is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error** and **R²**.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Modeling**: Implements models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² to assess prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression)

## Dataset

The dataset contains attributes of laptops such as:
- Brand
- RAM size
- Processor details
- Storage options
- Screen size
- Operating system

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amith080902/Laptop-Price-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Install necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open `Machine Learning_Mini_Proj.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to run the model and predict laptop prices.

## How to Use

- Use the dataset (`laptop_price - dataset.csv`) to train and test the machine learning models.
- Evaluate model performance and improve predictions with different algorithms.
